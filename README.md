🎣💀 phisher-Z — Advanced Educational Phishing Attack Simulator

phisher-Z is a highly advanced phishing-attack simulation framework designed exclusively for educational purposes, cybersecurity awareness, and ethical research.
This tool demonstrates how modern phishing operations work in the real world — from deceptive login pages to advanced social-engineering tactics — all within a safe, controlled training environment.

phisher-Z simulates a wide range of attacker techniques, including:

🔐 Credential Harvesting Simulation

🧭 Geolocation Capture Simulation (Location Theft Demo)

📸 Camera Capture Simulation (Victim Photo Capture Demo)

🎤 Microphone Access Simulation

🎭 Full Browser & Device Fingerprinting

🌐 URL Spoofing & Social-Engineering Techniques

🔓 2-Step Verification Bypass simulation through deceptive UX flow

🕵️ Realistic phishing-page replication for awareness training

⚡ phisher-Z is built to help students, cybersecurity trainees, and professionals understand how attackers trick users, how phishing traps are constructed, and why proper cyber-hygiene is essential.
